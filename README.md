    - Ipad air & mini
    - iPhone SE, XR, and 12Pro
    - Pixel 5
    - Samsung Galaxy S8, S20 Ultra, A51/71
    - Surface Pro 7 & duo
    - Galaxy Fold
    - Nest Hub & Hub Max

    <p>I also tested the website on iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and a Lenovo legion 5, the only issue I've encountered is that on the iPhone 7 and 8 one element didn't stay consistent with its original design, check out the link below for pictures.</p>

    [Unresolved](#unresolved)

## Browsers
- The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. There were no issues with any of the browsers and the design looked consistent on all the browsers.

## Bugs
### Problem
<p>The contact form is out of alignment</p>

![Contactpage](imagesreadme/contactpage.png)
### Resolved
<p>By removing the footer</p>

![contactpage](imagesreadme/contactfixed.png)
### Problem
<p>The contact form stretches to far outside of the viewport height.</p>

![Contactpage](imagesreadme/contactform.JPG)
### Resolved
<p>By adding specific style rules to a media query this issue was resolved.</p>

![contactpage](imagesreadme/contactformfixed.PNG)
### Problem
<p>The issue here is the section stretches too far down and outside of the image, the aim is to have the Back-to-the-top link inside of the explore section image.</p>

![backtop](imagesreadme/backtop.PNG)
### Resolved
<p>By adding a font-size value of (4.2vmin) to the paragraph in media queries I managed to fit the whole section inside the image</p>

![backtop](imagesreadme/backtopfixed.PNG)
<br>

## Unresolved
### Problem
<p>This problem is only visible on a mobile phone, the Send! the button doesn't stay consistent and true to the original design, I have a hard time trying to figure out how to fix it because I can't create the same effect in Chrome Developer Tools, even though I use the same width and height as an iPhone 7.</p>
