## Lighthouse
- Lighthouse was used to test the sites: 
    - Performance - How the page performs during loading.
    - Accessibility - How accessible is the site and how can it be improved?
    - Best Practices - How does the site live up to industry best practices?
    - SEO - Search engine optimization.
<br>

<p>After a few tests and changes I managed to increase the score by changing image formats and adding a meta description to the head.</p>

## Fourth test

## Responsiveness
- I tested the responsive design with [Chrome Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/)
    - Ipad air & mini
    - iPhone SE, XR, and 12Pro
    - Pixel 5
    - Samsung Galaxy S8, S20 Ultra, A51/71
    - Surface Pro 7 & duo
    - Galaxy Fold
    - Nest Hub & Hub Max

    I also tested the site on iPhone 7, iPhone 8, and a Lenovo legion 5, the only issue I've encountered is that on the iPhone 7 and 8 2 site elements didn't fit the screen, this can be fixed in the future with better media queries.

## Browsers
- The site was tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Safari. There were no issues with any of the browsers and the design looked consistent on all the browsers.

## Unresolved
### Problem
<p>This problem is only visible on a mobile phone, the Send! button doesn't stay consistent and true to the original design, I have a hard time trying to figure out how to fix it because I can't create the same effect in Chrome Developer Tools, even though I use the same width and height as an iPhone 7.</p>
